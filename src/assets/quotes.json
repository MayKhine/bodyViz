  "You are more than a number. Progress is about how you feel, not just what you weigh.",
  "This is your journey. Every step matters, not just the destination.",
  "Your body is your home. Be kind, stay curious, and treat it with care.",
  "Strong isn’t a size. Healthy doesn’t have a single look. Keep going.",
  "It’s not about being perfect. It’s about showing up and trying again.",
  "Every small win matters. Together, they lead to big change.",
  "Progress takes time. It doesn’t have to be a straight line.",
  "You are not defined by pounds, inches, or percentages.",
  "Real change begins with self-love, not pressure or shame.",
  "Data helps you understand your body. It’s not here to judge you.",
  "You don’t need to be in control. You just need to be connected to yourself.",
  "Your body has carried you through hard days. It deserves your gratitude.",
  "Every entry shows you showed up. That’s something to be proud of.",
  "You’re not behind. You’re growing in your own time.",
  "Track your progress with love. Reflect gently. You’re doing great."
